### Brute Force Attack:

A hacking method that involves systematically trying every possible combination of passwords or keys until the correct one is found.

#### Types of Brute Force Attacks:

1. **Simple Brute Force Attack:**  
    Involves trying all possible combinations of passwords without any modifications or optimizations.  
    
2. **Dictionary Attack:**  
    Uses a pre-defined list of common words and phrases to guess the password.  
    
3. **Hybrid Attack:**  
    Combines dictionary attacks with additional variations like adding numbers or symbols to common words.  
    
4. **Reverse Brute Force Attack:**  
    Starts with a known password and tries to match it against multiple usernames.  
    
5. **Credential Stuffing:**  
    Uses stolen username-password pairs from one service to try and gain access to other services.
