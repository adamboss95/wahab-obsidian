### What is Ransomware?

- **Definition:** Ransomware is a form of malware that encrypts a victim's data or locks them out of their system, demanding a ransom payment to restore access
- **Attack Method:** Attackers typically gain access to a system through phishing emails, infected websites, or exploiting software vulnerabilities. Once inside, the ransomware encrypts files or locks the system, making it unusable until the ransom is paid
- **Ransom Demand:** The ransom is usually demanded in cryptocurrency (e.g., Bitcoin) to make it harder to trace

Types of Ransomware:
- **Encrypting Ransomware:** This type encrypts the victim's data, making it inaccessible until the ransom is paid and the decryption key is provided
- **Non-Encrypting Ransomware:** This type locks the victim out of their system, often displaying a ransom note on the screen
- **Double-Extortion Ransomware:** In addition to encrypting data, this type also threatens to leak stolen data if the ransom is not paid
- **Triple-Extortion Ransomware:** This type takes the threat further by using stolen data to attack the victim's customers or business partners
