**RAID** stands for **Redundant Array of Independent Disks**. It is a technology that combines multiple hard drives into a single unit to improve performance, increase storage capacity, and provide data redundancy.

### Key Benefits:

1. **Performance:** RAID can improve read and write speeds by distributing data across multiple drives.
    
2. **Redundancy:** RAID provides data protection by storing copies of data on multiple drives. This helps prevent data loss in case of a drive failure.
    
3. **Capacity:** RAID can increase the overall storage capacity by combining the space of multiple drives.
    

### Common RAID Levels:

4. **RAID 0 (Striping):**
    
    - **How It Works:** Data is split and written across multiple drives.
        
    - **Benefits:** Improved performance.
        
    - **Drawbacks:** No redundancy; if one drive fails, all data is lost.
        
5. **RAID 1 (Mirroring):**
    
    - **How It Works:** Data is duplicated and written to two drives.
        
    - **Benefits:** Redundancy; if one drive fails, data is still available on the other drive.
        
    - **Drawbacks:** Requires double the storage capacity; no performance improvement.
        
6. **RAID 5 (Striping with Parity):**
    
    - **How It Works:** Data and parity information are distributed across three or more drives.
        
    - **Benefits:** Redundancy and improved performance; can tolerate a single drive failure.
        
    - **Drawbacks:** Slower write performance compared to RAID 0; requires at least three drives.
        
7. **RAID 10 (1+0):**
    
    - **How It Works:** Combines RAID 1 (mirroring) and RAID 0 (striping).
        
    - **Benefits:** High performance and redundancy; can tolerate multiple drive failures.
        
    - **Drawbacks:** Requires at least four drives; expensive due to the need for additional drives.
        

### Example:

Imagine you have three hard drives:

8. **RAID 0:** Data is split across all three drives, improving speed but offering no protection against failure.
    
9. **RAID 1:** Data is mirrored on two drives, providing redundancy but no speed improvement.
    
10. **RAID 5:** Data and parity are distributed across all three drives, offering a balance of performance, redundancy, and capacity.
