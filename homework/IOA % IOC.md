| Credential theft=> means if credentials are stolen cyberattack is in progess                                        | IPAddress                  |
| Credential exploitation => after credential theft, next step is exploitation of the network or system.              | Vulnerability Exploitation |
| Lateral Movement => attacker moving lateraly, trying to exploit the credentials stolen to move to different segment | Malware Injection          |

IOC limitations:
- IOC detection compares potential threats to a database of known attack signatures
