### Brute Force Attack:
A hacking method that involves systematically trying every possible combination of passwords or keys until the correct one is found.

#### Types of Brute Force Attacks:

1. **Simple Brute Force Attack:**
    Involves trying all possible combinations of passwords without any modifications or optimizations.
        
2. **Dictionary Attack:**
    Uses a pre-defined list of common words and phrases to guess the password.
        
3. **Hybrid Attack:**
    Combines dictionary attacks with additional variations like adding numbers or symbols to common words.
        
4. **Reverse Brute Force Attack:**
    Starts with a known password and tries to match it against multiple usernames.
        
5. **Credential Stuffing:**
    Uses stolen username-password pairs from one service to try and gain access to other services.


### CIA
In cybersecurity, **CIA** stands for **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability**. These three principles are the foundational pillars of information security:

1. **Confidentiality:**
    Ensuring that sensitive information is accessed only by authorized individuals and remains protected from unauthorized access.
        
2. **Integrity:**
    Maintaining the accuracy and completeness of data, ensuring that it is not altered or tampered with by unauthorized individuals.
        
3. **Availability:**
    Ensuring that information and resources are accessible to authorized users whenever needed, without undue delay.

**Non-repudiation** is a principle that ensures that a party in a communication cannot deny the authenticity of their signature on a document or a sent message











### DoS (Denial of Service)

1. **What it is:**
    
    - A DoS attack involves a single source (one computer or network) overwhelming a target system (such as a website or server) with excessive traffic or requests.
        
    - The goal is to make the target system slow, unresponsive, or completely unavailable to legitimate users.
- **How it works:**
    
    - The attacker sends a large number of requests or data packets to the target, consuming its resources (like CPU, memory, or bandwidth) until it can no longer respond to legitimate traffic.
        
- **Example:**
    
    - Imagine a small shop where only one customer is allowed to enter at a time. If one person keeps going in and out repeatedly, real customers won't be able to enter and make purchases.

Real Life Example:
**Project Rivolta (2000):** This attack targeted 16 major companies, including well-known names like Amazon, eBay, and CNN. The attackers overwhelmed these companies' servers with a flood of traffic, causing significant downtime and financial losses estimated at $1.7 billion. The attack exploited the relatively nascent state of internet security at the time, leading to widespread disruption.



### DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service)

1. **What it is:**
    
    - A DDoS attack is similar to a DoS attack but involves multiple sources (often thousands or millions of compromised computers, also known as a botnet) targeting a single system.
        
    - The goal is the same: to make the target system slow, unresponsive, or completely unavailable to legitimate users.
        
2. **How it works:**
    
    - The attacker uses a botnet to send a massive amount of traffic or requests to the target system, overwhelming its resources. Because the attack comes from many different sources, it's harder to block or mitigate.
        
3. **Example:**
    
    - Imagine the same small shop, but now thousands of people are trying to enter at the same time. The shop will be overwhelmed, and real customers won't be able to enter.


### Snort

What is Snort?

**Snort** is the foremost Open Source Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) in the world. Snort IPS uses a series of rules that help define malicious network activity and uses those rules to find packets that match against them and generates alerts for users.
