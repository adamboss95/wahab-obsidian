### Key Differences:

1. **File Reading:**
    
    - `while` **loop:** Directly reads each line from the file.
        
    - `for` **loop:** Reads the entire file content at once and then splits it into words based on whitespace, which may not handle line breaks correctly.
        
2. **Efficiency:**
    
    - `while` **loop:** More efficient for large files, as it processes one line at a time.
        
    - `for` **loop:** Loads the entire file into memory, which can be inefficient for large files.
        
3. **Simplicity:**
    
    - `while` **loop:** More straightforward and commonly used for reading files line by line.
        
    - `for` **loop:** Requires additional steps to handle lines correctly.
        

### Summary:

Using the `while` loop is more suitable for this scenario because it efficiently reads each line from the `mal_ip` file and processes it. The `for` loop is less convenient for this purpose and may lead to issues with handling line breaks.
