### Key Distribution Center (KDC)

A **Key Distribution Center (KDC)** is part of a cryptosystem that helps securely distribute cryptographic keys to users or devices. It's commonly used in systems like **Kerberos**, which authenticate users and services in a network

#### How KDC Works:

1. **Authentication**: The KDC verifies the identity of users or devices requesting access
2. **Key Distribution**: Once authenticated, the KDC provides session keys for secure communication between the user and the service
3. **Ticket Granting**: In Kerberos, the KDC issues tickets that allow users to access services without repeatedly entering credentials
