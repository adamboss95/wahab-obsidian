## Witch Attack

**Witch attack** mainly takes place with the node failure which results in the loss of data by the use of factual link for future communication.

## Sinkhole Attack

A **sinkhole attack** is a cybersecurity technique where malicious traffic is redirected to a controlled server (the "sinkhole") instead of its intended target.

## Difference Between Witch Attack Sinkhole Attack

- If a compromised system in an organization is not known to be compromised, it is a **witch attack**, if it is known and data is leaking then it is **sinkhole attack**

## Supply chain Attack
A **supply chain attack** targets a trusted third-party vendor to gain access to their larger trading partners. For example, attackers might insert malicious code into software updates from a trusted vendor, which then spreads to all users of that software.


## HoneyPot Attack

**honeypot** is a security tool used to attract and deceive cyber attackers. It acts like a trap or decoy, mimicking a real system or network to lure attackers and study their methods without risking actual valuable systems.

### Working:

1. **Set Up:** A honeypot is designed to look like a legitimate system or network, complete with fake data and services.
    
2. **Attraction:** Attackers are drawn to the honeypot, thinking it's a valuable target.
    
3. **Observation:** Security experts monitor the honeypot to observe the attackers' techniques, tools, and behaviors.
    
4. **Analysis:** The information gathered is used to improve security measures and protect real systems.



what is threat intel? where do we collect data from?
**Threat intelligence**, also known as **cyber threat intelligence (CTI)**, is data collected, processed, and analyzed to understand and anticipate cyber threats. It helps organizations make informed decisions to protect against potential attacks.

## botnets, its attack

**Botnet** attacks use a command and control model to allow one or more hackers to drive the actions of those devices (often called ‘zombie bots’) from a remote location. The more devices that have been infected with the attacker’s malware, the stronger the attack is likely to be

### How do botnet attacks work?

Botnet attacks can be carried out by a single person or team. Either way, a force of zombie bots is controlled by the bot herder, which is the individual or group driving the attack. The bot herder can build their own botnet from scratch or rent it from other bad actors (sometimes dubbed “malware-as-a-service,” or MaaS).  
  

Once infected, zombie bots are anonymously controlled via a centralized client-server model or decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) model.
