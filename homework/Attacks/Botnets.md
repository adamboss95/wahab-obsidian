## Botnets, its attack

**Botnet** attacks use a command and control model to allow one or more hackers to drive the actions of those devices (often called ‘zombie bots’) from a remote location. The more devices that have been infected with the attacker’s malware, the stronger the attack is likely to be

### How do botnet attacks work?

Botnet attacks can be carried out by a single person or team. Either way, a force of zombie bots is controlled by the bot herder, which is the individual or group driving the attack. The bot herder can build their own botnet from scratch or rent it from other bad actors (sometimes dubbed “malware-as-a-service,” or MaaS).  
  

Once infected, zombie bots are anonymously controlled via a centralized client-server model or decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) model.


## What are botnet attacks used for?

Cybercriminals employ botnet attacks for a number of reasons, with money and power usually at the root of their strategy. Once they have control of zombie devices, they can access operations normally reserved for admin-level users, such as:  
  

- Monitoring user activity
    
- Collecting user data
    
- Installing and operating applications
    
- Transferring sensitive data or files
    
- Identifying vulnerabilities in other network devices
    
- Reading and writing data in the system
    

With these abilities now under their control, an attacker could use them for ad-hoc crimes, including:

- Stealing money outright
    
- Extorting payments 
    
- Mining for cryptocurrency 
    
- Stealing confidential account data
    
- Selling their stolen access to others
    

Many times, botnet attacks are used to enable a secondary scheme. Once they’re in control, there are a handful of standard tactics attackers might use to do so, depending on their ultimate goal.

### Spam and phishing

Email spam and phishing scams go hand-in-hand. These social engineering tactics are extremely common methods for enticing and then tricking users into giving up login credentials or other sensitive information. If phishing is successful, it may grant access to the victim’s device, adding it to the botnet.

### Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)

DDoS is one of the most common types of botnet attacks. Under DDoS, an attacker inundates a network with heavy traffic with the goal of disrupting service. 

One notorious example of this is the 2016 Mirai botnet attack, which managed to take down a major domain name service provider. Mirai caused performance disruptions and complete outages of services including Netflix, Twitter, CNN, and others. It also affected an entire country (Liberia) and several of Russia’s biggest banks.

### Brute force

[Brute force](https://www.pingidentity.com/en/resources/blog/post/what-is-brute-force-attack.html) is used when the attacker doesn’t have access to their target’s login passwords. So instead, they try to seize them by force. Credential stuffing and dictionary attacks may be used to take advantage of weak user passwords and gain access to the associated data.
