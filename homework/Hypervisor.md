## **Hypervisor** and its types
A **hypervisor** is software that allows multiple virtual machines (VMs) to run on a single physical computer. Think of it as a manager that divides and allocates resources (like CPU, memory, and storage) to each VM so they can operate independently, as if they were separate computers.

### Types of Hypervisors:

1. **Type 1 Hypervisor (Bare-Metal):**
    
    - Runs directly on the physical hardware.
        
    - Provides better performance and efficiency.
        
    - Examples: VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V, Xen.
        
2. **Type 2 Hypervisor (Hosted):**
    
    - Runs on top of an existing operating system.
        
    - Easier to set up but less efficient than Type 1.
        
    - Examples: VMware Workstation, Oracle VM VirtualBox, Parallels Desktop.
