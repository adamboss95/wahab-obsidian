## Witch Attack

**Witch attack** mainly takes place with the node failure which results in the loss of data by the use of factual link for future communication.

## Sinkhole Attack

A **sinkhole attack** is a cybersecurity technique where malicious traffic is redirected to a controlled server (the "sinkhole") instead of its intended target.

## Difference Between Witch Attack Sinkhole Attack

- If a compromised system in an organization is not known to be compromised, it is a **witch attack**, if it is known and data is leaking then it is **sinkhole attack**

## Supply chain Attack
A **supply chain attack** targets a trusted third-party vendor to gain access to their larger trading partners. For example, attackers might insert malicious code into software updates from a trusted vendor, which then spreads to all users of that software.


## HoneyPot Attack

**honeypot** is a security tool used to attract and deceive cyber attackers. It acts like a trap or decoy, mimicking a real system or network to lure attackers and study their methods without risking actual valuable systems.

### Working:

1. **Set Up:** A honeypot is designed to look like a legitimate system or network, complete with fake data and services.
    
2. **Attraction:** Attackers are drawn to the honeypot, thinking it's a valuable target.
    
3. **Observation:** Security experts monitor the honeypot to observe the attackers' techniques, tools, and behaviors.
    
4. **Analysis:** The information gathered is used to improve security measures and protect real systems.
