## Network Address Translation (NAT)

Translates private IP to public IP and Public IP to Private IP to gain access to internet.

> [!NOTE]
> we cannot access internet through private ip, internet can be access only by public ip, which is where NAT helps us access internet by translating private ip to public ip and public ip to private ip
